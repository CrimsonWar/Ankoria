The performance of the so called "Maestro" is over. And aparently not with the applause he wanted.
If i believe witnesses the "Maestro" made his very flashy entrance and then shortly after was obliterated
by the group sent by the Ordo Magica. He seems to have put on a teasure hunt to find him, and then 
wanted a climatic Battle between the "Heroes" and himself. He underestimated the brutality of 
adventurers, ending with him as a stain on the fountain. And surprisingly everything he stole was 
returned, with just minor complaints by navy personel that had to clean up what was left of the
"Maestro". On the brighter side, he seems to have left behind an Orchestra of kobolds, if anybody 
can get me in contact with them, i would like to hire them. Stay safe Ankoria, and i hope you 
don't get tied into one of those situation, where this group of the Ordo magica is needed!
