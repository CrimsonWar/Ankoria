As some of my Sources have told me there is a special thief going around 
the Crohena Archipel. And with that Region being the richest in the 
Raging Enclave, they might be going for the Jackpot. But some People might 
ask: 'What makes that thief so special, Byn?', let me tell you. They are 
using something that is very dear to my heart as a bard, the power of music.
More specifically one of my sources of the Navy, or whatever Lord Strongmaw 
calls his militia, told me, for a heist that Thief starts a Musical number 
and everyone who hears it participates. The same source also told me that they have contacted the
Ordo Magica, so looking back at the Skipperglen incident, one of those super 
Magical artifact might be involved. But we will se how this situation turns out.
