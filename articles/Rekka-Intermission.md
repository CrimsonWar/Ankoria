It is a Dark Hour for the Ordo Magica. I just recieved an anonymous letter
updating me about the situation in the Frozenlands. If this letter is to be trusted,
then our Operatives Sportacus, Galkom Stongheart, and Delion Haavjete have died.
I trust this letter, because they named our Operatives by their names, which we haven't
made public in any of our public reports on the Incidents we sent them to.
May Woz guide our remaining Operatives in the field, and may Woz also guide me to find
new recruits for the Grand-Artifact-Devision.
