People, we have a situation, this time in the Frozenlands. And ironically it involves 
a lot of fire. Acording to reports, a Knight in shining armor and surounded by fire 
is killing the residents and burning the villages in the Deliah Region. If you ask me,
this seems like another one of those situations where one of those mega artifacts, the
Ordo Magica has been dealing with recently, is involved. And in my Oppinion, if you 
disregard the killing and burning of innocents, that burning knight sounds really 
fucking cool. But alas i hope the special devision of the Ordo Magica will be dealing 
with him shortly.
