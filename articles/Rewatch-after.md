So, we finally have an Update on the Situation in Skipperglen. The Dome is Gone.
And aparantly most of the Residents didn't even Notice that something has been going on.
From the inside the Dome seems to have been see-through and it looked like a normal day from 
that perspective. On a sadder note, while the dome was up the mayor of the little town was 
murdered and two residents are missing. The guard has come to the conclusion that the missing
residents had something to do with the murder and then dipped the town, which is kinda weird 
with the dome still being up at that point. But we will see what the Ordo Magica will publish 
about this incident and if this is just the start of something bigger.
