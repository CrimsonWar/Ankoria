So, whats been going on in Ankoria as of late? Well there has been a development in the Bythehammer Diarchy.
The little Town of Skipperglen has been covered in what seems to be a gigantic dome. Right now i can't give you any more details on thet dome,
because frankly I and my sources have no Idea either. What I can do is give you Info on the Town that disapeared under the Dome.
Because Persoanlly i don't think many people have ever heard of Skipperglen. Why do i think that? Easy, it had nothing going on before this.
Skipperglen was founded as a miningtown, but after the mine didn't yield any valuables anymore, all Skipperglen had for it was the peacful 
countryside. So after decades of nothing, something is finally happening there. Well, let's see how this Situation develops, because some of 
my sources have said the Ordo Magica preparing  to send some People in. This has been Byn`fy with what is happening in Ankoria!
